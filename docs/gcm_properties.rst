GCM Properties
==============

Properties for the *i-th* compound in a mixture are defined as the sum of contributions from first- and second-order groups. The equations are presented below:

.. math::

   M_{w,i} = \left[\sum_{k = 1}^{N_{g_1}}\N_{ik}m_{w1k} + W \sum_{j = 1}^{N_{g_2}}\M_{ij} m_{w2k} \right] \times 10^{-3}

   T_{c,i} = 181.28 \ln  \left[ \sum_{k=1}^{N_{g_1}} \N_{ik} t_{c1k} + W \sum_{j=1}^{N_{g_2}} \M_{ij} t_{c2j} \right]
