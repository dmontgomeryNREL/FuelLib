Welcome to PyFLARE's documentation!
===================================

The **Python Fuel Library for Advanced Research on Evaporation (PyFLARE)** utilizes
the group contribution method (GCM), as developed by Constantinou and 
Gani\ :footcite:p:`constantinou_new_1994,constantinou_estimation_1995` in the mid-1990s
with additions from Govindaraju and Ihme (2016)\ :footcite:p:`govindaraju_group_2016`, 
to provide a systematic approach for estimating the thermodynamic properties of
pure organic compounds. If you need help or have questions, please use the
