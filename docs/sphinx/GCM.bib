Leveraging the AMReX library, the Pele suite of combustion simulation tools targets the largest supercomputers available and future exascale machines. We introduce PeleC, the compressible solver in the Pele suite, and detail its capabilities, including complex geometry representation, chemistry integration, and discretization. We present a comparison of development efforts using both OpenACC and AMReX’s C++ performance portability framework for execution on multiple GPU architectures. We discuss relevant details that have allowed PeleC to achieve high performance and scalability. PeleC’s performance characteristics are measured through relevant simulations on multiple supercomputers. The success of PeleC’s design for exascale is exhibited through demonstration of a 160 billion cell simulation and weak scaling onto 100\% of Summit, an NVIDIA-based GPU supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Our results provide confidence that PeleC will enable future combustion science simulations with unprecedented fidelity.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Combustion encompasses multiscale, multiphase reacting flow physics spanning a wide range of scales from the molecular scales, where chemical reactions occur, to the device scales, where the turbulent flow is affected by the geometry of the combustor. This scale disparity and the limited measurement capabilities from experiments make modeling combustion a significant challenge. Recent advancements in high-performance computing (HPC), particularly with the Department of Energy's Exascale Computing Project (ECP), have enabled high-fidelity simulations of practical applications to be performed. The major physics submodels, including chemical reactions, turbulence, sprays, soot, and thermal radiation, exhibit distinctive computational characteristics that need to be examined separately to ensure efficient utilization of computational resources. This paper presents the multiphysics solver for the Pele code suite, called PeleMP, which consists of models for spray, soot, and thermal radiation. The mathematical and algorithmic aspects of the model implementations are described in detail as well as the verification process. The computational performance of these models is benchmarked on multiple supercomputers, including Frontier, an exascale machine. Results are presented from production simulations of a turbulent sooting ethylene flame and a bluff-body swirl stabilized spray flame with sustainable aviation fuels to demonstrate the capability of the Pele codes for modeling practical combustion problems with multiphysics. This work is an important step toward the exascale computing era for high-fidelity combustion simulations providing physical insights and data for predictive modeling of real-world devices.},

            A new group contribution method for the estimation of properties of pure organic compounds is presented. Estimation is performed at two levels: the basic level uses contributions from first‐order groups, while the next higher level uses a small set of second‐order groups having the first‐order groups as building blocks. Thus, the method provides both a first‐order approximation (first‐order group contributions) and a more accurate second‐order prediction (first‐ and second‐order group contributions). This article discusses methods for prediction of normal boiling point, normal melting point, critical pressure, critical temperature, critical volume, standard enthalpy of vaporization at 298 K, standard Gibbs energy, and standard enthalpy of formation at 298 K. The predictions are based exclusively on the molecular structure of the compound, and the method is able to distinguish among isomers. Compared to the currently‐used methods, this technique demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy and applicability.},

              The development of advanced air transportation has raised new demands for high-performance liquid hydrocarbon fuels. However, the measurement of fuel properties is time-consuming, cost-intensive, and limited to the operating conditions. The physicochemical properties of aerospace fuels are directly influenced by chemical composition. Thus, a thorough investigation should be conducted on the inherent relationship between fuel properties and composition for the design and synthesis of high-grade fuels and the prediction of fuel properties in the future. This work summarized the effects of fuel composition and hydrocarbon molecular structure on the fuel physicochemical properties, including density, net heat of combustion (NHOC), low-temperature fluidity (viscosity and freezing point), flash point, and thermal-oxidative stability. Several correlations and predictions of fuel properties from chemical composition were reviewed. Additionally, we correlated the fuel properties with hydrogen/carbon molar ratios (
              n
              H/C
              ) and molecular weight (
              M
              ). The results from the least-square method implicate that the coupling of H/C molar ratio and
              M
              is suitable for the estimation of density, NHOC, viscosity and effectiveness for the design, manufacture, and evaluation of aviation hydrocarbon fuels.},

              Modeling of heat and mass transfer in liquid fuel combustion requires several material properties in a wide temperature and pressure range. The unavailable data are commonly patched with various estimation methods. In this paper, group contribution methods (GCM) and law of corresponding states (LCS) were analyzed for estimating material properties of n-alkanes (up to C

              ). These were compared to reference data to evaluate their applicability. LCS suggested by Poling et al. provides proper estimation for the acentric factor. GCM of Joback accurately estimates normal boiling point, critical properties, and specific heat capacity of the vapor-phase, the latter was corrected for methanol, however, GCM of Constantinou is more accurate for critical pressure of methyl esters. GCM of Ruzicka is suitable for estimating liquid-phase specific heat capacity. This method was updated for methanol. GCM of Elbro gives a proper estimation for liquid-phase density, while LCS of Lucas estimates vapor-phase viscosity properly. LCS of Chung and the modified Eucken method for vapor-phase and GCM of Sastri for liquid-phase thermal conductivity are appropriate. Considering the gas-phase mutual diffusion coefficient, the method of Fuller provides the best estimation, while LCS methods of Riedel and Chen are suitable for the enthalpy of vaporization at the normal boiling point.},

Two particular CFD codes are explored. The first is uFVM, a three-dimensional unstructured pressure-based finite volume academic CFD code, implemented within Matlab. The second is OpenFOAM®, an open source framework used in the development of a range of CFD programs for the simulation of industrial scale flow problems. With over 220 figures, numerous examples and more than one hundred exercise on FVM numerics, programming, and applications, this textbook is suitable for use in an introductory course on the FVM, in an advanced course on numerics, and as a reference for CFD programmers and researchers},

	abstract = {The greenhouse gas (GHG) emission mandate on jet fuel requires a gradual reduction in the fuel’s GHG emissions, up to 50\%, by 2050. For this reason, the demand for bio-jet fuel blended with conventional petroleum-derived jet fuel will increase. In order to meet the quality requirement of blended fuels (ASTM D7566), modeling that can predict the correlation between properties is required. Our aim was to predict the low-temperature properties using the distillation profile results obtained from Simulated Distillation (SIMDIS) according to the carbon number and chemical compositions of bio-jet fuel through correlation and regression analysis. We used hydroprocessed ester and fatty acid (HEFA) bio-jet fuel and hydrocarbon reagents that included C8, C10, and C12 carbons and five main families of hydrocarbons for blended jet fuel. This study shows an overall trend for each component, indicating that the distilled volume fraction is more affected than the carbon number. In the case of the freezing point, by composition, n-paraffin and naphthene have regression coefficients of more than 0.85 for the 50\% and 60\% recovery temperatures, respectively. In terms of carbon number, the C8 sample has a significant regression coefficient for the 40\% recovery temperature, and C10 has a significant regression coefficient for the initial boiling point (IBP) and 10\% recovery temperature. In the case of kinematic viscosity, by composition, the regression coefficient is significant for the 20\% to 40\% recovery temperatures. For naphthene, the kinematic viscosity exhibited no relationship with carbon number. This information can be utilized to determine the blended ratio of bio-jet fuel and conventional jet fuel in newly certified or commercial applications.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Combustion encompasses multiscale, multiphase reacting flow physics spanning a wide range of scales from the molecular scales, where chemical reactions occur, to the device scales, where the turbulent flow is affected by the geometry of the combustor. This scale disparity and the limited measurement capabilities from experiments make modeling combustion a significant challenge. Recent advancements in high-performance computing (HPC), particularly with the Department of Energy's Exascale Computing Project (ECP), have enabled high-fidelity simulations of practical applications to be performed. The major physics submodels, including chemical reactions, turbulence, sprays, soot, and thermal radiation, exhibit distinctive computational characteristics that need to be examined separately to ensure efficient utilization of computational resources. This paper presents the multiphysics solver for the Pele code suite, called PeleMP, which consists of models for spray, soot, and thermal radiation. The mathematical and algorithmic aspects of the model implementations are described in detail as well as the verification process. The computational performance of these models is benchmarked on multiple supercomputers, including Frontier, an exascale machine. Results are presented from production simulations of a turbulent sooting ethylene flame and a bluff-body swirl stabilized spray flame with sustainable aviation fuels to demonstrate the capability of the Pele codes for modeling practical combustion problems with multiphysics. This work is an important step toward the exascale computing era for high-fidelity combustion simulations providing physical insights and data for predictive modeling of real-world devices.},
